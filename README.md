# Vulkan Renderer In Odin

This is pulled from this youtube tutorial: https://youtu.be/Y9U9IE0gVHA?si=H0yIecpJkBeA08rT. I simply port each phase to odin here in each branch. I will be implementing it using the same abstractions as this gist that already achieves some vulkan rendering in odin: https://gist.github.com/terickson001/bdaa52ce621a6c7f4120abba8959ffe6
