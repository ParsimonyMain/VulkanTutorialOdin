# Vulkan Renderer In Odin

This is pulled from this youtube tutorial: https://youtu.be/Y9U9IE0gVHA?si=H0yIecpJkBeA08rT. I simply port each phase to odin here in each branch. I will implement this with minimal abstraction until it becomes genuinely necessary to reduce complexity and make the code more ergonomic.
